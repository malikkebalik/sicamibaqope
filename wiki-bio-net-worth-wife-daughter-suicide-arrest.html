He is the son of Todd Chrisley, the wealthy and eccentric star in the show Chrisley Knows Best. Kyle appeared on the first season of the show, but was later kicked off by his father, who accused him of being a drug addict and a liar. Kyle has also struggled with bipolar disorder, addiction, suicide attempts, and legal troubles. He is the father of Chloe Chrisley, a biracial girl who is being raised by Todd and Julie Chrisley. Kyle is currently married to Ashleigh Nelson. In this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Kyle Chrisley.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wiki/Bio Facts</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tr><th>Fact</th><th>Description</th></tr><tbody readability=10><tr><td>Full name</td><td>Kyle Hayden Chrisley</td></tr><tr><td>Date of birth</td><td>August 29, 1991</td></tr><tr><td>Place of birth</td><td>South Carolina, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Zodiac sign</td><td>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td>Gender</td><td>Female</td></tr><tr><td>Sexuality</td><td>Straight</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Siblings</td><td>Lindsie, Chase, Savannah, and Grayson Chrisley</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Chloe Chrisley</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Marital status</td><td>Married to Ashleigh Nelson</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Previous marriages</td><td>Angel Victoria Johnson , Alexus Whilby</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Occupation</td><td>Former reality TV star, musician, and entrepreneur</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Net worth</td><td>estimated between $500,000 to $ 1 million</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>TV shows</td><td>Chrisley Knows Best (season 1), The Real (guest appearance)</td></tr><tr><td>Music projects</td><td>Lexi & Kyle Chrisley</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christian</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/website-24.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life</h2><p>Kyle Chrisley was born on the 29th of August 1991 to <a href=# rel=noopener>Todd Chrisley</a> and his ex-wife Teresa Terry. Born and raised in South Carolina USA, Kyle is the first-born child of Todd Chrisley. His parents met in high school and got married in the late 1980’s. Little is known about Kyle’s early life and there are little to no details on his persona life. As far as academia goes, Kyle graduated from Saint Francis High School. Following his parents’ divorce, Kyle decided to stay with his mother. From a young age, Kyle started doing drugs and the habit followed him well into adulthood.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Professional Career</h2><p>Akin to his personal life, there is very little information about Kyle’s professional life. Todd rose to fame after making appearances in the family TV series, Chrisley knows best. However, Kyle worked only in the first season of the show and left the series in 2014. After his marriage to Alexus, Kyle and Alexus formed a music duo, Lexy & Kyle Chrisley. The pair released a few singles including Shame on You, Outta Here, and Country Baby. None of the pair’s songs were well received and the musical duo closed shop.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Problems with drugs</h2><p>For the longest time, Kyle Chrisley has struggled with drugs and substance abuse. He found his way into drugs at a young age and continued well into adulthood. Back in the early 2010’s, Kyle tied the knot with Angel Victoria Johnson. However, the relationship did not last long, owing to Kyle’s abusive behavior and drug problem. While the pair divorced soon after, they had a daughter, Chloe Chrisley. It is believed that both Kyle and Angle had a drug problem, which is why when Chloe was six-months-old, the custody was handed to Todd Chrisley. In 2013, Kyle applied for visiting rights to see his daughter but lost the legal battle.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Suicide</h2><p>Following his marriage to <a href=# rel=noopener>Alexus Whilby</a> (m.2014), Kyle decided to come clean. However, he failed to do so, and ultimately they divorced in 2018. In May of 2019, Kyle was arrested in Oklahoma for possessing methamphetamine. While the charges were dropped one month later, Kyle was issued a warrant by a judge in Georgia for allegedly threatening his wife.<br>However, in September of 2019, Kyle attempted suicide and was rushed to the hospital. Following the failed attempt, Todd took to media to say that he would not give up on his son and would try to make rehab work. Kyle revealed that he had been using certain medications that induced suicidal thoughts.</p><p>“I take medication and I had a bad side effect to it and I tried to take my own life. With the meds, I got all kinds of crazy thinking going on.”</p><p>Supporting his son, Todd took to media to say that Kyle was off the medication which induced such thoughts.</p><p>“I think some of the medications they put you on—that you had not been on—one of the side effects is suicidal tendencies and we’re now off of that.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Life after Suicide Attempt</h2><p>After overcoming adversity that came in on his way, Kyle reconciled with his father in 2019, after apologizing for his past behavior and expressing his gratitude for his support. He also reconnected with his daughter Chloe and became a part of her life again. Kyle found love with Ashleigh Nelson, whom he dated for a few months before proposing to her with a diamond ring in February 2021. He married her in a private ceremony in March 2021. He also maintained a close relationship with his father and siblings. Kyle also joined to work in a truck rental company in Smyrna, Tennessee .</p><p>However, on March 13, 2023, Kyle was involved in a physical altercation with his supervisor at work, during which he allegedly pulled out a fixed blade knife and threatened to kill or stab him. Next day, Kyle voluntarily appeared for booking procedures related to the active warrant for aggravated assault.&nbsp;He was arrested by the Smyrna Police Department and transported to the Rutherford County Adult Detention Center.&nbsp;His bond was set at $3,000 and he was released after posting it. Kyle was scheduled to appear in court on March 28, 2023, to face the felony charge of aggravated assault.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Physical Traits</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tr><th>Physical Trait</th><th>Description</th></tr><tbody readability=2.5><tr><td>Height</td><td>5’11″ (approx.)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Eye color</td><td>Hazel green</td></tr><tr><td>Hair color</td><td>Blonde</td></tr><tr><td>Hair style</td><td>Short and spiky</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Facial features</td><td>Oval face, prominent nose, thin lips, stubble beard</td></tr><tr><td>Body type</td><td>Athletic and muscular</td></tr><tr><td>Skin tone</td><td>Fair and tanned</td></tr><tr><td>Tattoo</td><td>A cross on his left arm</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kyle Chrisley FAQs</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=19><tr readability=2><td>Is Kyle Chrisley the oldest son of Todd Chrisley?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Is Kyle Chrisley still married to Alexus Whilby?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Is Kyle Chrisley the father of Chloe Chrisley?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Is Kyle Chrisley still on Chrisley Knows Best?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Is Kyle Chrisley bipolar?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Is Kyle Chrisley a musician?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Is Kyle Chrisley in jail?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Is Kyle Chrisley estranged from his father?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Is Kyle Chrisley adopted?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Is Kyle Chrisley involved in his father’s tax fraud case?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Is Kyle Chrisley a Christian?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Is Kyle Chrisley a reality TV star?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Is Kyle Chrisley a grandfather?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Is Kyle Chrisley a twin?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Is Kyle Chrisley gay?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Is Kyle Chrisley suing his father?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Is Kyle Chrisley dating anyone?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Is Kyle Chrisley happy?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Is Kyle Chrisley sober?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Is Kyle Chrisley a good father?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Is Kyle Chrisley alive?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Did Kyle Chrisley attempt suicide in 2019?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Did Kyle Chrisley get arrested for assault in 2023?</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Did Kyle Chrisley reconcile with his father and family in 2020?</td><td>Yes</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qippake6S7zGiisqSVYrCpvsiso56xXay2rLWMsKCfnV2Zrrazx62cq2WjqraktcOeZJ2qpZx8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bernie-mac-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bernie Mac Net Worth">&larr;
