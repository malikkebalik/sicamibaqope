Introducing his baby mama, Jaidyn Alexis, as they become parents<br></p><p><strong>On Friday, August 5, 2022, Blueface welcomed his second child with Jaidyn Alexis.</strong></p><p>Alexis shared a photo of herself clutching her newborn’s tiny foot on Instagram to announce the news. The post’s heading read:</p><p>In a video she posted on Instagram in December 2021, Alexis revealed her pregnancy to Blueface. She could be seen in the footage delivering the rapper a gift box in front of a Christmas tree. The heading stated:</p><p>“This year, it seems like Christmas came a little early.”<br>In the footage, the couple’s son can also be seen continuously pleading with his father to open the box. He questioned Alexis, “Are you pregnant,” after realizing after a while that the box contained a positive pregnancy test.</p><p>The artist hugged her when she replied “yes.”</p><h2>Additionally, Blueface is the father of a 5-year-old boy</h2><p>In addition to their new daughter, Blueface and Alexis Jaidyn also have a 5-year-old son.</p><p>On April 29, 2019, Javaughn J. Porter was born. Since then, he has participated in various radio appearances with his father. Additionally, he appeared in Bluface’s 2018 album Dead Locs.</p><p>On his right forearm, Blueface has a tattoo of his son’s name. The rapper claimed in an interview with Big Boy’s Neighborhood that because Javaughn’s mother worked all week, he got to spend a lot of time with his son and as a consequence, they have a close relationship.</p><p>Although Alexis and Blueface occasionally post about their son, it should be noted that they have never shared much information regarding Javaughn’s private life.</p><h2>Jaidyn Alexis: Who is she?</h2><p>Instagram model and well-known social media influencer Jaidyn Alexis. She has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and is well known for posting images of her daily life there.</p><p>In 2019, she first began sharing images on Instagram.</p><p>She also serves as the CEO of Babyface Skin & Body LLC in Glendale, California. Despite being so well-known, she does not have a Wikipedia page, therefore nothing is known about her career and parents.</p><h2>The history of Blueface and Jaidyn Alexis’s relationship is examined</h2><p>Despite having two children together and having originally met in high school, the couple is no longer together.</p><p>After she wrecked the rapper’s car and other belongings when she discovered him having an extramarital affair with another lady in 2020, Jaidyn became a social media sensation.</p><p>Alexis shared a video of the two of them in 2021, indicating that they were still dating at the time Porter was once more connected to another woman. Currently, the video has been removed.</p><p>While Alexis hasn’t shared any images of the rapper in a while, she routinely uploads images of her baby.</p><p>Following the 2018 release of the Respect My Cryppin’ music video, Blueface saw an increase in popularity. The most popular track of his career, Thotiana, was then released after he was signed to the record company Cash Money West. Find the Beat, his debut album, was published in 2020.</p><p>Porter and Chrisean Rock have had a sporadic connection. Rock reportedly lost one of her teeth in a previous fight with Alexis.</p><p>In February 2022, Rock was detained in Oklahoma after stealing Porter’s automobile to travel back to Baltimore. Porter’s boss also charged her with robbing them and stole their Mercedes G-Wagon along with some cash from their home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGiuoZmkYru2ucGeqWanlmKwqbXLnamepl2ZvKa%2FjJujrp2WlrCmecearZ5lmaPBs7vDrpqippditaq%2FjJuYm7Fdoq6urYyjmKKcqaN6orjEsaCsZZGoerW0xLJkm52TpLqmec%2BaqZ6mpKh8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-trevor-eve-and-sharon-maughan-s-son-jack-eve-dating-to.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Trevor Eve and Sharon Maughan's Son, Jack Eve Dating To?">&larr;
