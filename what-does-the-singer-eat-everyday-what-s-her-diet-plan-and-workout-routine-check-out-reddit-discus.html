In her recent photos, the singer seems to have lost quite a bit of weight. Some Reddit users think her breakup is the reason behind it. Some think it's because she got a breast reduction. But those are just speculations and fans want to know more about her weight loss, what Billie Eilish eats on a daily basis, her diet, and her workout routine.</strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell</strong></a> (b. December 18, 2001) is an American <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>singer</strong></a>-songwriter. Her debut single Ocean Eyes, written and produced by her brother <strong>Finneas O'Connell,</strong> with whom she collaborates on music and live shows, first gained her public attention in 2015.</p><p>Don't Smile at Me, her debut extended play, was released in 2017 and was commercially successful, reaching the top 15 of record charts in a number of countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. Eilish has received seven Grammy Awards, two American Music Awards, two Guinness World Records, three MTV Video Music Awards, three Brit Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award.</p><p>Additionally, Billie Eilish is the youngest artist in Grammy history to win all four general field categories in the same year, including Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Album of the Year. In 2019, she was named to Time magazine's inaugural Time 100 Next list, as well as the Time 100 list in 2021.</p><p>Similarly, she is the 26th highest-certified digital singles artist and one of the decade's most successful artists. Aside from that, she has a history of political activism, particularly in the areas of climate change awareness and women's equality.</p><p>Billie Eilish attended the Environmental Media Association Awards Gala in Los Angeles in October where she debuted her new look after a weight loss, and now fans want to know more about her transformation, including how she lost weight. So, here is everything we know about Billie's weight loss journey!</p><p>Previously, we touched on the&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>weight loss</a></strong> stories of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Austin Cowburn</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Dan + Shay</strong></a>.</p><h2>Billie Eilish Weight Loss: How Does the American Singer Look Now? What Does She Eat Everyday? Check Out Details About Her Diet Plan and Workout Routine, and Discussions on Reddit!</h2><p><strong>Billie Eilish's</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@billieeilish</a>) weight loss has been a hot topic on the Internet since her fans noticed her new look after she lost a significant amount of weight in 2022. After comparing her <a href=# rel=noopener>previous</a> and recent photos, Reddit users are now speculating on this topic, and there are various rumors about why and how Eilish lost weight.</p><p>No matter how she did it, it's a great thing that Billie Eilish is now content with her body after a weight loss transformation. She has previously spoken out about her body insecurities and she seems to have learned and had quite a growth since then but she always makes conversations about body image issues even now so, don't expect her to back down from the subject now.</p><p>The Happier Than Ever singer has admitted that she was unhappy with the way her body appears. We noticed a shift in Eilish's relationship with her body when she turned 18, as she began to shed the layers of large clothing she had been hiding behind to protect herself from criticism and reclaim her sexuality.</p><p>Billie Eilish looked confident and like she was no longer still torn between accepting her body and hiding. Did people glimpse a slight weight loss then? When asked about her diet, the Bad Guy hitmaker revealed that she was raised as a vegetarian her entire life and has never eaten meat. She transitioned from vegetarian to vegan in 2014, avoiding all dairy and eggs. She told <a href=# rel=noopener>Vogue</a> that it's all about what makes you happy.</p><p>Billie Eilish really took over the internet in 2020 with her new style when she started wearing less bulky clothing than usual. Having begun dressing differently than she had previously, which made her look more stylish and like a work of art, she seemed to be more comfortable with her body then. People began to be more aware of her body size after the change in her styling.</p><p>Recently, after she <a href=# rel=noopener>attended</a> the Environmental Media Association Awards where she and her mother was <a href=# rel=noopener>honored</a> with the EMA Missions in Music Award, Billie Eilish's fans began to notice her weight loss. Her new look is being discussed online, on Twitter, Reddit, and everywhere, and people are curious about how she lost weight.</p><p>There are various takes on Billie Eilish's weight loss we can see being discussed on various forums such as Reddit. Some of her fans and admirers think that the Your Power singer lost weight after her breakup with the much older <strong>Matthew Tyler Vorce</strong>. The singer and actor announced their separation in May 2022. Some people think she appears to have lost weight because she has had a breast reduction.</p><p>The 20-year-old singer has not confirmed whether her break-up or breast reduction is the reason behind her weight loss. There's also a chance that she lost weight because she wanted to. In an interview in 2021, Billie Eilish admitted that she struggled with her weight. In the picture of her wearing the green tank top that was going viral on the internet, she did appear to be a <a href=# rel=noopener>little overweight</a>. So, it was not the breakup but a conscious decision on her part.</p><p>Billie Eilish's struggles with weight are very well-known. She has spoken about how she used to self-harm because of her weight when she was very young and how she even took weight loss pills when she was only 12 years old. Now, maybe she did it in a healthy way.</p><p>After all, the songwriter has started going to the gym on a regular basis though she has noted that she doesn't go to the gym for weight loss. The No Time To Die singer is a champion dancer, a global popstar, and a style icon, but she wasn't a gym rat until recently. Discussing her new gym-rat status and explaining why she began working out more seriously in the first place, Billie Eilish said that she has adopted a new touring strategy and her new <a href=# rel=noopener>gym-going</a> habit was more about preparing her body for her incredibly busy performances - injury-free.</p><p>Although she has not yet specified what her new daily gym routine consists of, the mention of strength and stability would imply that weight lifting is included. She seems to have undergone weight loss because of the daily workouts she's been doing.</p><p><strong>Visit&nbsp;<a href=#>House & Whips</a>&nbsp;for more&nbsp;<a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGiZoqScnrJusciloKygXayyqrPHrWSlp6OofA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-happens-if-you-vomit-during-colonoscopy-prep.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happens If You Vomit During Colonoscopy Prep">&larr;
