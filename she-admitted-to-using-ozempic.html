The first time her fans witnessed her physical transformation was in 2018 when her fitness trainer shared her before and after weight loss pictures on his Instagram page. To say the change in her body was drastic would be sort of an overstatement because she was never overweight in the first place and she didn't look like she had much weight to lose.</p><p>But whatever little change it was, it was very significant and noticeable because Marlo Hampton looked much more toned and had a defined body shape in the after picture. That photo of hers made the fans' jaws drop. They were extremely impressed with her weight loss transformation which the trainer revealed took a lot of hard effort and dedication. Her trainer, the fitness expert <strong>Kory Phillips</strong> who has shaped <strong>Reginae Carter</strong>, <strong>Kashdoll</strong>, <strong>Toya</strong> <strong>Wright</strong>, and <strong>Riley Burruss</strong>, shared the secret behind the <a href=# rel=noopener>‚Äúnoticeable difference‚Äù in her body</a>.</p><p><strong>@marlohampton has been training about 3-4 times a week, intermittent fasting for 16 hours a day AND eating a high protein diet, mid/low carbs & low fats; not to mention wine daily & occasional fried food meals üò°. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èHOWEVER, In less than 30 days, she‚Äôs made a noticeable difference on the scale, in her face, her arms & her DEFINITELY some definition in her midsection. üî•üî•üî• #teamlovelybodies #revengebodyexpert #lovelybodiesatlanta #WNM</strong></p><h2>Marlo Hampton Admitted to Using Ozempic for Weight Loss!</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/09/marlo-hampton-pic2.jpg alt="Marlo Hampton admitted to using Ozempic for weight loss. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Marlo Hampton admitted to using Ozempic for weight loss.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Essence</strong></p><p><strong>Marlo Hampton</strong> unfortunately was not able to maintain that weight loss for long. She regained all the pounds back during COVID-19. In 2020, she revealed that she had had weight gain after <a href=# rel=noopener>she stepped on the scale</a> while she was on self-quarantine and realized the numbers were not skewed in favor of fitness. She photographed the number - 199.8 - and wrote a caption cussing out the coronavirus and self-quarantine, expressing her frustration,&nbsp;"S--t just got real!!!!" She also added, "Diet starts NOW!"</p><p>Marlo Hampton was able to maintain her weight loss right up till the quarantine when she was following her diet routine which included two shakes a day, one protein bar cut in half, two meals that consisted of protein and green vegetables, 96 ounces of water, and three cocktails, consistently. She couldn't continue it while on quarantine and so, she gained all the weight back again.</p><p>Marlo Hampton said that she was going to start her dieting again and she might have. She has lost weight since 2020 again but admittedly, it might be due to her <a href=# rel=noopener>use of Ozempic</a>. She opened up about using the generic brand of weight loss drug to <a href=# rel=noopener>get in shape for her new look during the RHOA reunion</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGikmqqcpHqprcypq6imXayyqrPHrWSlp6OofA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./she-wasn-t-surprised-hollywood-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="She Wasnt Surprised  Hollywood Life">&larr;
