From 2006 through 2011 and again from 2013 to the present, Sean Payton served as their head coach.

He lived in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, where he attended elementary and middle school (1970 to 1978). Sean attended Naperville Central High School in Naperville, Illinois, where he graduated in 1982 after beginning his senior year as a quarterback.</p><p>Payton joined the Sigma Chi Fraternity while attending Eastern Illinois University, where he played quarterback and enjoyed a tremendous career, guiding the Panthers to an 11-2 record and the Division I-AA Playoffs quarterfinals in 1986.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table class="table table-striped facts" style=height:100%;width:100%><tbody><tr><th>Full Name:</th><td><strong>Patrick Payton</strong></td></tr><tr><th>Born Date:</th><td>29 Dec 1963</td></tr><tr><th>Age:</th><td>57 years</td></tr><tr><th>Horoscope:</th><td>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><th>Lucky Number:</th><td>6</td></tr><tr><th>Lucky Stone:</th><td>Topaz</td></tr><tr><th>Lucky Color:</th><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><th>Best Match for Marriage:</th><td>Scorpio, Virgo, Taurus</td></tr><tr><th>Gender:</th><td>Male</td></tr><tr><th>Profession:</th><td>Football coach</td></tr><tr><th>Country:</th><td>USA</td></tr><tr><th>Height:</th><td>5 feet 11 inches</td></tr><tr><th>Marital Status:</th><td>divorce</td></tr><tr><th>Divorce</th><td>Beth Shuey</td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth</th><td>$22 million</td></tr><tr><th>Salary</th><td>$8 million</td></tr><tr><th>Eye Color</th><td>Hazel</td></tr><tr><th>Hair Color</th><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Place</th><td>San Mateo, California</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality</th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th>Education</th><td>Naperville Central High School</td></tr><tr><th>Father</th><td>Thomas</td></tr><tr><th>Mother</th><td>Jeanne Payton</td></tr><tr><th>Kids</th><td>two (daughter: Meghan and son: Connor)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Is_Sean_Payton_Single_Relationship>Is Sean Payton Single? Relationship</span></h2><p>Meghan and Connor are Sean Payton’s children; they are married to Beth Shuey. They started a nonprofit foundation called Payton’s Play It Forward Foundation. The foundation seeks to enhance the well-being, educational opportunities, and social welfare of families and children. Annually, they also host the Black and Gold Gala, which has drawn notable visitors like Brad Pitt, Dr. Phil, and a few more.</p><p>In June 2012, Beth filed for the couple’s legal separation, citing their divergent personalities as the cause. The pair legally divorced in 2014. Payton took care of the children while Beth was in charge of them. Rumor has it that Beth irked Payton before asking for a divorce. Beth, on the other hand, never cited it as the reason she needed the separation in the press or court. She and her kids are currently residing in Texas. On the other side, Payton visits occasionally to spend time with the kids.</p><h2><span id=How_tall_is_Sean_Payton_Weight_Hair_Color>How tall is Sean Payton? Weight, Hair Color</span></h2><p><strong>Sean Payton has maintained good physical health. He measures 5 feet 11 inches in height and 91 kg in weight. We don’t know what his other body dimensions are. He does have brown and hazel eyes, though.</strong></p><h2><span id=How_did_Sean_Payton_start_his_Professional_Career>How did Sean Payton start his Professional Career?</span></h2><p>At San Diego University, Sean Payton started his coaching career in 1988 as a combative coworker. After leaving his job at the institution, he worked as a secondary school teacher for numerous organizations. In 1997, he received a promotion to quarterback coach with the Philadelphia Eagles. He retired the next year, and in 1999 he was hired by the New York Giants as their quarterback’s coach. Payton took up the role of the group’s hostile facilitator the next year, helping the Mammoths win Super Bowl XXXV.</p><p>Payton was hired by the New Orleans Saints as their head trainer in 2006. With Payton’s arrival, the squad recaptured its former glory and started winning games once more after struggling and rarely winning any games before his entrance (after a poor first season). With his great teaching skills, he had an impact on the group and helped the Saints achieve their first winning season in six years.</p><p>They had one of the best details in the group, had excellent execution, and were first in passing while placing fifth in scored focuses. Payton kept inspiring the team to impressive victories. In 2007, he was presented with the Associated Press NFL Coach of the Year Award. With a 10-6 record, he also assisted the New Orleans Saints in winning the NFC South. In Super Bowl XLIV in 2000, Payton steered the club to a 31-17 victory over the Indianapolis Colts.</p><p>Home Team: Coaching the Saints and New Orleans Back to Life, written by Sean Payton, was published in 2010. The book, which had Ellis Henican as a co-author, opened at No. 8 on the New York Times Bestseller list. On October 16, 2011, while coaching a game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Payton collided with tight end Jimmy Graham’s helmet after Graham had been tackled on the sideline, breaking his tibia and tearing his MCL.</p><p>The Saints coaching staff ran a bounty program between 2009 and 2011 that offered money to New Orleans defensive players who hurt opponents, according to information the NFL released in March 2012. As retribution for their participation in the operation, they suspended Payton for the entire 2012 NFL season. Additionally, they placed both former defensive coordinator Gregg Williams (who joined the Rams earlier in the 2012 offseason) and general manager Mickey Loomis on an indefinite suspension and eight-game ban, respectively.</p><p>Along with the unusual personnel sanctions, the team was also hit with a $500,000 fine and lost two second-round draft picks. After that turbulent off-season, the Saints finished 7-9 in 2012 but bounced back the following year with Payton back in charge, winning 11 games and securing a playoff spot. The Saints’ defense degenerated into one of the worst in the league even though they continued to field one of the league’s top offenses the following two years. New Orleans had three straight 7-9 records from 2014 to 2016.</p><p><strong>Also, How<a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>&nbsp;Does Katie George, An ESPN Sporyscaster, Get Paid?</a></strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Zsuzsa Kormoczy</a></h3>Zsuzsa Körmöczy estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
