She said that over their ten years of marriage, he would mistreat her both physically and sexually.</p><p>She allegedly accused Stephen of pressuring her to have a threesome with their nanny Lorraine Giles, according to TMZ sources. In addition, she said that he pushed her to get an abortion and pregnant her. To get it done, he even offered her $300,000 from Mel B’s wallet.</p><p>She added that he had several sex videos of her and threatened to make them public to damage her reputation. She further said that he was carrying a gun even though he was forbidden from doing so because of a prior domestic abuse charge against another woman.

It was ludicrous and unjustified, he claimed.</p><p>A statement that TMZ was able to get Stephen accuses Mel B of lying and claims that she is doing it to safeguard her reputation and television career. His attorney added that Belafonte angrily disputes the accusations and that it is unfortunate that Brown did not respectfully accept the private affair.</p><p>“When the truth is revealed by the Court, it will be evident that the entire drama was nothing more than a smear campaign designed to conceal Ms. Brown’s actions during the marriage in light of her current participation in a family television program, and in an attempt to unfairly obtain leverage about the children’s custody and finances.”</p><h2><span id=Before_the_two-week_trial_the_restraining_order_was_revoked_in_a_deal>Before the two-week trial, the restraining order was revoked in a deal.</span></h2><p>Following a confidential agreement between them, Stephen and his ex-wife’s legal battle came to an end.

In a similar vein, he was charged with beating up two guys in 2000; however, the case was dropped when Stephen consented to cover the costs of the damage done to their car.</p><p>He was accused of domestic abuse against Nicole Contreras, his ex-girlfriend, three years later. Furthermore, he acknowledged using a brick to kill a duck outside his home in 2007 but fled to Los Angeles without paying the £300 punishment.</p><p>Last but not least, he got into a brawl with three men in the May Fair Hotel in 2010 while out with his ex-wife Mel B, and one of them needed medical attention.</p><h2><span id=A_Brief_Synopsis_Of_Mel_B_Stephen8217s_Former_Wife_She_is_an_actress_and_singer>A Brief Synopsis Of Mel B, Stephen’s Former Wife: She is an actress and singer.</span></h2><p>Melanie Janine Brown, an English singer-songwriter, actress, and well-known television personality, was born in Leeds, West Yorkshire, on May 29, 1975.
