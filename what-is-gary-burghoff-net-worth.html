Although he suffered from a congenital deformity in three fingers of his left hand, he became a drummer and also studied tap dancing. He started his career in acting while studying in high school, acting with the BelfRy Players in Wisconsin. He first earned fame as he portrayed the title role in the play “You’re A Good Man, Charlie Brown” in 1967. At the time, he also served as a drummer for the band “The Relatives” which included actress Lynda Carter&nbsp;as the lead singer. Due to Gary’s friendship with&nbsp;Carter, he subsequently earned a chance to become a member of the cast in “The New Adventures Of Wonder Woman”, a television series of the late 1970s.</p><p>Gary started getting noted for his acting skills while working on the “Wonder Woman” series. He made his feature film debut in 1970 playing the role of Radar O’Reilly in the movie “M*A*S*H”. He continued his role as Radar in the television series of the same name and became the only person in the movie as a regular cast in the series. For his role as Radar O’Reilly in the series, he was nominated for six Emmy Awards, winning one in 1977 in the category of Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. The award was accepted by Gary’s co-star&nbsp;Alan Alda&nbsp;on his behalf.</p><p>Apart from the “M*A*S*H” television series, Gary appeared in several more television shows marking his prominence on the small screen. Notably, he appeared in game shows like “Tattletales”, “Showoffs” and “Hollywood Squares” and in television series like “W*A*L*T*E*R”, “The New Adventures Of Wonder Woman” and several more. Gary worked with actors like Joanna Cameron, Peter Kastner, and Louise Sorel in the movie “B.S. I Love You”.</p><p>Gary retired from acting in 2010, but being a part of all these film and TV projects has earned well for Gary Burghoff allowing him to lead his life as a multi-millionaire artist.</p><p>Gary Burghoff is a divorcee and the father of his three children. He was married twice, firstly to Janet Gayle in 1971 with whom he had a child in their eight years-long marriage. His second marriage was with Elisabeth Bostrom and the couple shared two kids in their twenty years of married life; they divorced in 2005.
