They chose to access the property by leaping the fence without getting permission or a permit.</p><p>Unfortunately, a watchful neighbor saw what they were doing and immediately called the police, which resulted in their detention. The Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office was visited by them.</p><p>Their mugshots went viral on Twitter as soon as the news of their arrests started to circulate on social media. Fans who were worried created a petition asking the police to free them, and the hashtag #FreeSamandColby quickly gained popularity.</p><p>Fans clearly cared about the couple and supported them, as seen by the letters they received urging them not to bother the police station and expressing support for them.</p><p>Fortunately, the YouTubers were freed on January 17, 2019, the next day. They used Twitter to thank their supporters and ensure their followers that they were safe.</p><p>They also discussed the event, calling it a “blessing in disguise” that inspired them to reexamine their processes for producing material and make improvements to their channel.</p><h2><span id=Details_of_the_Sam_and_Colby_case>Details of the Sam and Colby case</span></h2><p>At the time of their arrest, Sam and Colby were accused of trespassing in a structure that was still being built. Due of their fame on YouTube, their arrest received a lot of media attention, although this was still their sole known run-in with the authorities.</p><p>After the event, they decided to be more careful when accessing fenced-off or restricted locations, and they recruited a new crew to help them assure the safety and legality of their expeditions.</p><p>Despite the event, online celebrities have carried on with their YouTube careers, devoting themselves to producing interesting and worthwhile material.</p><p>Since then, they have stayed out of problems with the law and have become more dedicated to their YouTube channel, working to enthrall and excite their viewers with their exploits.</p><h2><span id=Wiki_Sam_and_Colby>Wiki Sam and Colby</span></h2><p>Sam and Colby are American YouTube artists noted for their exploratory and comedic material. Sam was born Samuel John Golbach on November 27, 1996, while Colby was born Cole Robert Brock on January 2, 1997.</p><p>They’re from Kansas Overland Park and went to Blue Valley High School. Their hilarious videos, such as the “Following Fat People” and the “Public Disturbance” series, helped them first achieve notoriety on the now-defunct app Vine.</p><p>The couple first concentrated on humor and challenge videos on their YouTube channel, which they started on October 28, 2014. However, starting in 2020, their focus has changed to the Overnight Series and Exploration Series.</p><p>In this series, they explore creepy and haunting areas while recording their experiences there.</p><p>Samuel and Cole have a YouTube channel and have made many videos using characters they’ve developed called Samantha and Colleen. These characters, who are presented as clumsy and overdramatic gals, provide the narrative with some entertainment value.</p><p>Sam and Colby have made use of their YouTube channel as their main source of income to build a sizable fan base and garner international notice.</p><p>They have an online store called XPLR that sells apparel made for adventure.</p><p>They used to have a website called The Life Project that supported people who were having difficulties, but it has now been replaced with a new website dedicated on assisting kids in succeeding.</p><p>After a short sabbatical, the YouTubers declared their comeback to video production in 2019, although with a changed aesthetic.</p><p>The Stanley Hotel, Witches Forest, and The Kansas Trip, three timely series that provide their audience unique and engrossing stories, have received the majority of their most recent uploads from them.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Kaylin Wiley, Averie Gilley, and Sophierosejm."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4480,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial"}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":23}{"1":25,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":38}{"1":44,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":56}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/kaylin-wiley/"}{"1":23}{"1":25,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/averie-gilley/"}{"1":38}{"1":44,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/sophierosejm/"}{"1":56}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Kaylin Wiley</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Averie Gilley</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Sophierosejm</a>.</span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>YouTubers</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Dominic Toliver | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Chad Fryer Accident: What Happened To Him?
