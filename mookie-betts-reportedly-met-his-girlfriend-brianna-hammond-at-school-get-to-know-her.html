He played with the team until 2019, and during that time, he won four Gold Glove Awards, three Silver Sluggers, and was named the 2018 American League MVP.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>On the field, he’s an athlete, relentless and determined. But when he arrives home, Betts only thinks about taking care of his daughter.</strong></h3><p class=dh>Over the past five years, Betts has cemented his reputation as an all-rounder. He is regarded by many experts as the second most valuable player in the MLB, only behind Los Angeles Angels’ center field <a class="me a" href=#>Mike Trout</a>.</p><p class=dh>Dodgers’ president of baseball operations, Andrew Friedman, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/sports/dodgers-mookie-betts-agree-to-12-year-365-million-extension/2400716/>described</a> Betts’ deal as a great investment, one that the organization made with confidence in Bett’s talent and potential.</p><p class=dh>Betts shared the news on Instagram <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CC97MgsFqYF/>posting pics</a> of himself outside the Dodgers’ stadium while signing some papers. In his caption, he thanked the organization, and most importantly, his family for their unwavering support.</p><p class=dh>Brianna Hammonds, Betts’ girlfriend, couldn’t be prouder of his feat, and she too took to her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/briannamichelle1/>Instagram</a> stories to show her excitement about this new chapter in their lives.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MEET MOOKIE BETTS’S GIRLFRIEND</strong></p><p class=dh>Brianna Michelle Hammond is Bett’s longtime girlfriend and the mother of his only child. The couple reportedly met in middle school In Tennessee and have been together since then.</p><p class=dh>The oldest picture in Hammond’s Instagram is one of her smooching Betts, and in the caption, she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/O30fPiRoGZ/>celebrated their 7th anniversary</a>. That means the pair has been together for at least 15 years.</p><p class=dh>Hammond graduated from Middle Tennessee State University in 2015.
