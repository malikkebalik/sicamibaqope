The case, which was initially judged a suicide, took an unexpected turn when the cause of death was amended to uncertain, reversing the earlier status of suicide. Dennis allegedly poisoned his wife to collect over $1 million in life insurance and inheritance money to sustain his drug addiction. He was sentenced to prison this year after entering an Alford plea. He is serving his mandatory term of three to 10 years for voluntary manslaughter in connection with his wife's death in 2015.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p class=trending-main-title>TRENDING</p><a href=# aria-label="Only Sharp Eyes Can spot 3 differences"><img alt="Only Sharp Eyes Can spot 3 differences" width=300 height=168 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img4.fresherslive.com/quiz/2024/03/spot-the-difference-game-only-geniuses-can-spot-the-3-differences-in-this-squirrel-image-65e6a303545f687150017-1200.webp></a><a href=# aria-label="NYT Mini Crossword Answers Today"><img alt="NYT Mini Crossword Answers Today" width=300 height=168 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img4.fresherslive.com/crossword/2023/02/crossword-clue-home-1076100520-300.webp></a><a href=# aria-label="Only true geniuses can spot the mistake"><img alt="Only true geniuses can spot the mistake" width=300 height=168 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img4.fresherslive.com/quiz/2024/03/brain-teaser-puzzle-for-geniuses-only-true-geniuses-can-spot-the-mistake-in-this-2-girls-65e69f8da2da711100119-1200.webp></a><a href=# aria-label="Only Sharp Eyes Can Find the 3 Difference!"><img alt="Only Sharp Eyes Can Find the 3 Difference!" width=300 height=168 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img4.fresherslive.com/quiz/2024/02/brain-teaser-spot-the-difference-game-only-people-with-sharp-eyes-can-spot-2-differences-65d828d24ed4932993717-1200.webp></a><h2 id=why_did_gregory_brent_dennis_kill_his_wife_susan_winters class=smooth-goto>Why Did Gregory Brent Dennis Kill His Wife, Susan Winters?</h2><p>Winters' death was initially considered suicide after her husband informed investigators that she was despondent, frequently threatened suicide, and may have drunk prescribed medication laced with antifreeze, which killed her. A comprehensive examination, however, discovered that there was more to the story. In a forthcoming episode titled A Cool Desert Morning, Josh Mankiewicz will report on Susan Winters' murder case on Friday, October 7, 2022. The program will run on NBC at 9 p.m. ET. The article goes into much detail concerning Susan Winters and her husband's suspected murder.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 id=what_happened_to_gregory_brent_dennis class=smooth-goto>What Happened To Gregory Brent Dennis?</h2><p>Gregory Brent Dennis is now serving a three to the ten-year term for voluntary manslaughter at the Southern Desert Correctional Center in Indian Springs, Nevada. In February 2017, he was arrested for the case of Winters' murder. Dennis' attorney, Richard Schonfeld, blamed Winters' apparent suicide on earlier marital troubles. "The couple had been separated for many months less than two years before Winters' death. Winters' parents reported she was seeing a therapist for anxiety related to marital troubles, which she seemed to keep hidden from her family "according to ABC News. According to KTNV, Dennis was sentenced for the murder of Susan to "three to ten years in jail for voluntary manslaughter in connection with his wife's death in 2015" in May 2022. He had previously pleaded with Alford.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 id=who_exactly_is_gregory_brent_dennis class=smooth-goto>Who Exactly Is Gregory Brent Dennis?</h2><p>Gregory Dennis, a psychologist, called 911 at 6:48 a.m. on January 3, 2015, to report his wife was unresponsive in their bed. First responders discovered a faint heartbeat and brought her to the hospital, but she died later that afternoon after Gregory requested that she be taken off life support. The initial ruling in Susan's death was primarily based on what he told the police. Gregory admitted that he and Susan had fought the night before and that she had been drinking. Gregory went on to say that Susan was suicidal and on antidepressant medicine. During the initial interview, he said he left her asleep around 6 p.m. to go out with his daughters.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><ul readability=1.5><li><p>Susan Dennis</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Susan Winters Murder: Who Killed Susan Winters</p></li><li readability=0><p>Why Did Gregory Brent Dennis Kill His Wife, Susan Winters</p></li><li readability=-1><p>What Happened To Gregory Brent Dennis</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Who Exactly Is Gregory Brent Dennis</p></li></ul><p><i>Disclaimer</i>: The above information is for general informational purposes only.
