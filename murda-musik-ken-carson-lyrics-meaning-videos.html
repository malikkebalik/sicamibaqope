The song portrays the singer as being in control of his life, living it like a movie and enjoying the fruit of his success. The line "I let that chopper sang and they listen to it" refers to the singer's ability to use weapons and inflict harm on others, which he believes others fear and respect him for. His partner enjoys getting high with him, and they both indulge in drugs and alcohol to achieve a sense of escape from reality. They are also shown to be materialistic, with the singer boasting of buying his partner a brand new bag when he gets bored. However, he also touches on the responsibility that comes with having sex and how he has decided to avoid fatherhood by taking measures such as making a partner have an abortion or forcing them to take a Plan B pill.</p><br><p>The overall message of "Murda Musik" comes across as a celebration of a violent and reckless lifestyle, where material wealth and satisfaction come at any cost. The singer seems to express pride in being able to live his life on his terms, without any concern for the law or moral boundaries. The song is a reflection of a culture that supports destructive behavior and encourages self-indulgence.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a
