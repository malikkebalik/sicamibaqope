Keep reading to learn who they are and how old they are now.</span></p><p><a href=#><span data-preserver-spaces=true>NCIS</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;is CBS’ police procedural drama following the special agents of the Naval Criminal Investigation Service’s Major Case Response Team, the United States Navy’s primary federal law enforcement agency, which investigates criminal activity involving the Navy, the United States Marine Corps and their families. Harmon played Leroy Jethro Gibbs, a Supervisory Special Agent at the&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>NCIS</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, from Seasons 1 to 19.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After almost 20 years as a series regular on&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>NCIS</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, Harmon left the series at the start of Season 19. In a special featurette for the NCIS Season 19 DVD, Harmon — who was also an executive producer — hinted that he exited the series “to keep it fresh in his career. “What has always drawn me here is the character I play and to keep it fresh and to keep it challenging,” he said. “Plot-wise, this character has taken the path that it did. I thought it was honest and OK with.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Harmon explained to </span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Entertainment Tonight</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true> in November 2020 that his age also played a part in him leaving </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>NCIS</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. “I’ve always trusted the writers here… They’ve constantly been challenging here, the character continues to evolve, he’s getting older, and some of this I’m dealing with as an actor as well as playing the character,” Harmon said. Though he left in Season 19, Episode 4, Harmon remained in the opening credits of NCIS until the premiere of Season 20 in 2022.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Rocky Carroll, who plays NCIS Director Leon Vance, told&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span data-preserver-spaces=true>TV Insider</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;in January 2023, that Harmon could return one day. “I think as long as this show stays on the air, there will always be a little bit of a tease that we might see Gibbs again. First time I saw an episode of this show, I said, oh, it’s Gary Cooper from High Noon. Gibbs is the moral compass. He’s the moral compass that we all wish we had,” Carroll added.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2.-Mark-Harmon-and-Pam-Dawber-NCIS.jpg alt="Mark Harmon and wife Pam Dawber, NCIS" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In the actor’s personal life, the NCIS lead is married to fellow actress Pam Dawber.

It just wasn’t the right character or the right time. With Marcie, it was so funny because when they were casting, Mark goes, ‘Who you’re really looking for is my wife.’ They said, ‘But she’s always turned us down!” I read the script and I’m going, ‘Oh no.’ My fear rockets flew off.”</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Who are Mark Harmon’s children?</span></strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2.-Mark-Harmon-and-Family.jpg alt="Mark Harmon, wife and son" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>So, who are Mark Harmon and Pam Dawber’s children? Read on to learn about their two children (including which one appeared in a few episodes of&nbsp;NCIS).</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Sean Harmon</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Birthday: April 25, 1988 (Age 35)</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The couple welcomed their first son, Sean Harmon, in April 25, 1988. In an interview with </span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Closer Weekly</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true> in 2018, Harmon admitted that he wasn’t there to Sean take his first steps. “I was in the jungles of New Guinea making a not-very-good movie [</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Till There Was You</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>] when my firstborn took his first steps,” he described. “No job is worth missing life’s most important moments.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>When Sean grew up, he decided to follow in his parent’s footsteps as an actor (he’s also a stuntman and producer, too). According to his </span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span data-preserver-spaces=true>IMBd page</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, Sean has appeared in&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>NCIS, NCIS: Los Angeles, Major Crimes</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>CSI: NY.</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;Sean portrayed a younger version of his father’s character, Leroy Jethro Gibbs, in a few flashback scenes in Season 13, Episode 1 of&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>NCIS</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In November 2022, Harmon gave </span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Entertainment Tonight</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true> a detailed account of</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;his son’s NCIS audition. </span>“I always think back to the first time they talked about doing a young Gibbs thing here, and Sean was just out of school at that point. A director named Tony Wharmby said, ‘Can he come in and read?’ And on his own he did and I’m proud of him taking his work seriously and how he approaches being an actor — not just on this show, [but] just what he has chosen to try to do in his life’s work,” Harmon said. “I’m proud of both our boys, and they work hard at what they do and I’m proud that they get up in the morning and try to do that every day.”</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The actor added that his wife, Pam, was also very proud of Sean’s <i>NCIS </i>appearance.</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;“More than anything, she’s a mom, and there’s a pride there involved in that,” he explained. “Separate from anything as an actor, you hopefully take pride in who people are individually away from any camera just as people, as citizens. And both our boys have done well and hopefully made smart choices and are doing well daily, you know?” he praised. “Day by day, we have a lot of reasons to be proud of both of them, and this is part of that.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For Father’s Day 2023, Sean posted a tribute to his dad on Instagram. “To all the things that change, and those that never do. Love you dad #montana #fathersday,” Harmon’s son wrote alongside a photo of the pair enjoying the scenery in Montana.</span></p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ty Harmon</span></strong></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Birthday: June 25, 1992 (Age 31)</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Four years later, Mark and Pam had their second son, Ty Harmon, on June 25, 1992. Ty has also dabbed in the entertainment business as a writer; he wrote the short film, </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Catholic Schoolgirl Chainsaw Showdown</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, in 2012.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In an interview with&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Closer Weekly</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;in May 2018, Pam opened up about why she put her career aside to raise her and Mark’s kids. “I had children and it was like, ‘I’m not going to chase this fame thing,’” she said. “I wanted to drive my kids to school. I wanted to be there for their birthdays and bring cupcakes and doughnuts. And I was very happy to do it.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In the same interview, Harmon explained why his family keeps a low profile, especially on social media. “It’s not even a choice. It’s who we are,” he said. “We stay home. A lot. I’m not a Twitter guy or a Facebook guy. Our sons aren’t into that, either.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>NCIS</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;is available to stream on&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Paramount Plus</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For more on&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>NCIS’</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;casts children, check out our gallery of photos below of the cast’s real-life kids and families.</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhuZ21%2FdXyOppiro12drrO5zqdknKCZobGzsc1o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./michael-r-wasielewski.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael R.
