Mostly known for her role as Marilyn Monroe in the 2022 movie titled Blonde, the 50-year-old looks more stunning than she used to look in her prime days. However, she has neither admitted nor denied any of the allegations.</strong></p><p><strong>Poppy Montgomery</strong> (full name: <strong>Poppy Petal Emma Elizabeth Deveraux Donaghue</strong>) is an American <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>actress</strong></a> who achieved her greatest fame for her portrayal of FBI agent Samantha Spade in the CBS drama Without a Trace. Additionally, she is well-known for playing Detective Carrie Wells in the police drama, Unforgettable.</p><p>Montgomery has appeared as a guest star on numerous television shows, including Party of Five, NYPD Blue, and The Beat. A Surrogate's Nightmare, Snow Wonder, Signed, Sealed, Delivered from Paris with Love, and Jake Lassiter: Justice on the Bayou are just a handful of the television movies in which the actress has appeared as a recurring cast.</p><p>Montgomery has also appeared in a few movies, such as Tammy and the T-Rex, Devil in a Blue Dress, The Other Sister, Life, and Dead Man on Campus. Additionally, the bold beauty Montgomery is married and is the mother of three children.</p><p>Recently, Netflix released Blonde which stars <strong>Ana de Armas</strong>&nbsp;as <strong>Marilyn Monroe</strong>. However, this isn't the first time a movie titled Blonde was made. In 2001, a movie with the same title was released. It starred<strong> Poppy Montgomery&nbsp;</strong>as Marilyn Monroe. She has recently been on the highlight as many people still remember her role from her 2001 movie since Netflix released the movie. Similarly, many people believe that her appearance has changed significantly and wonder if she has ever undergone plastic surgery. Well, let's find it out.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>plastic surgery</a></strong> efforts of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Bobby Lytes</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jhene Aiko</strong></a>.</p><h2>Poppy Montgomeryâ€™s Plastic Surgery: The 50-Year-Old Is Accused of Undergoing Botox, Tummy Tuck, and Breast Augmentation!</h2><p><strong>Poppy Montgomery</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@therealpoppymontgomery</a>) appears to be getting younger every day, with her face being more radiant than ever. In fact, she appears considerably more attractive than she did in her twenties. Aside from her beautiful shape and attractive form, many people have noticed her new appearance and think that she must have undergone numerous plastic surgery treatments, including <strong>Botox</strong>, <strong>tummy tuck</strong>, and <strong>breast augmentation</strong>.</p><p>It is believed that the 50-year-old actress underwent face surgery that included a Botox injection. In order to eliminate any facial creases and lines, this injection is often administered in designated locations on the face. In most circumstances, it is quite rare to achieve the desired outcome on the first try, thus a client will need to have additional Botox injection treatments in order to keep their faces looking young.</p><p>Poppy Montgomery looks incredibly fresh and beautiful right now, despite her old age. It makes sense considering how she continues to captivate the crowd, particularly the guys. It's difficult to believe she's in her fifties because of how her face has transformed.</p><p>Her <a href=# rel=noopener>forehead</a> is the perfect place for her face to shine. Unbelievably, Poppy's face shows no indications of facial wrinkles or creases. Perhaps this is sufficient evidence to disprove allegations that she received a Botox injection, however, only specialists can do so. Without a doubt, the majority of her fans are drawn to her current sparkly smooth face, which is devoid of wrinkles.</p><p>When you compare her before and after pictures, you'll see that Poppy now appears a lot younger and more attractive than she did previously. This is abnormal since, at this age, you would anticipate some aging symptoms and one or two facial wrinkles on the forehead, but none exist. Most likely, her face is just right for Botox, giving her a beautiful natural face. It's more likely that the Poppy Montgomery plastic surgery story is accurate.</p><p>Breast augmentation is another she is often accused of. Also known as a breast lift or Mastopexy, it is a surgical procedure used to increase the breast. In order to give the breast a new shape that is in line with the structure of the body, the operation entails removing extra skin and tightening the tissues surrounding the breast.</p><p>Similarly, Poppy's breasts <a href=# rel=noopener>appear</a> larger than they once did in some photos. Some individuals think she really does have breast implants. However, even though her breasts appear larger in other photos, they still appear natural. Push-up bras are frequently used by actresses to create specific effects. Another option is that Poppy's breasts have naturally grown larger over time.</p><p>People have also speculated that she might have undergone a tummy tuck. This cosmetic treatment is&nbsp;frequently done on the abdomen to firm it up. The operation removes extra skin and fat from the abdomen to tighten it.</p><p><strong>Visit&nbsp;<a href=#>House & Whips</a>&nbsp;for more&nbsp;<a href=#>interesting stories</a>&nbsp;about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGinqKigrnquu82tnqillafGbrzLmqqtoZNiwLa%2Bxp6psmc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./theresa-zielinski-obituary-theresa-zielinski-has-sadly-passed-away-funeral-details.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Theresa Zielinski Obituary, Theresa Zielinski Has Sadly Passed Away, Funeral Details">&larr;
