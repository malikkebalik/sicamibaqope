The closest friends of the celebrity chef showed up to celebrate with her. Speaking about the event, Stewart disclosed that she hosted a dinner for 20 of her friends at the estate just outside Acadia National Park.</p><p class=dh>The lifestyle expert had local lobsters with caviar-filled roasted potatoes accompanied by her chardonnay and her friend, Molly Chappellet's cabernet sauvignon.</p><p class=dh>The Tv personality's birthday cake was a four-layered coconut treat served with fresh peach ice cream. Her friend, Kevin Sharkey, also made huge floral arrangements for her house. These included hydrangeas, snap dragons, delilahs, and lilies.</p><p class=dh>Because of the park surrounding her house, Stewart believed it was essential to maintain its features.

The TV star took inspiration from Edgar Rice Burrough's "Tarzan" series.</p><p class=dh>A year later, Stewart dressed up as a black cat. In 2007, she starred in a special Halloween issue of Martha Stewart magazine, donning two iconic looks.</p><p class=dh>On the front page, Stewart dressed up as a vampire, which she called a "glampire" look.

After transforming into a fairy grandmother in 2013, the former model donned mystical blue contact lenses for her Halloween 2018 look.</p><p class=dh>She appeared to be going for a blonde Cleopatra or a Bo Derek look.
