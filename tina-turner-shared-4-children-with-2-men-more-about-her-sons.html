The phenomenal woman who enthralled millions globally with her spellbinding music and zeal for life has left the world in mourning.</p><p class=Fg>Tina's passion for life and music shone brightly, even in the face of adversity.

So let's take a look inside the lives of iconic <a class="Xd a" href=#>singer's children</a> and their bond with their famous mother.</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>Craig Raymond Turner</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg><a class="Xd a" href=#>Craig Raymond Turner</a>, born August 29, 1958, was the firstborn son of Tina and saxophonist Raymond Hill. As a child, Craig was known to be highly emotional, particularly impacted by the <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.oprah.com/omagazine/oprahs-interview-with-tina-turner/2>tumultuous relationship</a> between his parents. Tina described him as a boy who'd "always look down in sadness."</p><p class=Fg>In a heartrending turn of events, Craig tragically <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/music/tina-turner-oldest-son-dead-by-suicide/>took his life</a> on July 3, 2018, at age 59. Tina honored her son in a touching ceremony, spreading his ashes off the coast of California. She shared her final goodbye in a heartfelt Twitter <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/tinaturner/status/1022753487921274880>post</a>, remembering him as her baby despite his age at passing.</p><p class=Fg>Tina has since <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rock-legend-tina-turner-on-her-voice-finding-serenity-and-losing-a-son-2019-06-30/#:~:text=I%20think%20Craig%20was%20lonely%2C%20that%27s%20what%20I%20think%20really%20got%20him%20more%20than%20anything%20else.%20I%20have%20pictures%20all%20around%20of%20him%20smiling%2C%20and%20I%20think%20I%27m%20sensing%20that%20he%27s%20in%20a%20good%20place.%20I%20really%20do.">reflected on Craig's life</a> and passing, recalling their last conversations, filled with his happiness and love for her. However, Tina believes solitude may have been a major factor in Craig's tragic decision.</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>Ronald "Ronnie" Turner</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg>Ronald "Ronnie" Turner was born on October 27, 1960, to Tina Turner and Ike Turner.

Love bloomed later in Ronnie's life when he tied the knot with French singer Afida Turner.</p><p class=Fg>Tragically, <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/music/tina-turner-son-ronnie-turner-died-of-colon-cancer/>Ronnie succumbed</a> to colon cancer on December 8, 2022, at the age of 62. The heartbroken Tina paid <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cl9Y5HtDRav/?hl=en">tribute</a> to her son on Instagram, expressing her sorrow over his untimely departure. Afida, mourning the <a class="Xd a" href=#>loss</a> of her husband, <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cl9c9moPYyM/>remembered</a> him as a "true angel" and her "best friend."</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>Ike Turner Jr.</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg><a class="Xd a" href=#>Ike Turner Jr</a>., born in 1958 to Ike Sr. and Lorraine Taylor, was adopted by Tina Turner when he was just two.
