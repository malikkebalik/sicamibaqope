Years went by, but the memories still knock the doors of our hearts. Amidst all, American actor <strong>Jon Hamm</strong>, best known for depicting the character of advertising executive&nbsp;<strong>Don Draper</strong>, has stayed in our minds.</p><p>From 2007 to 2015, Mad Men and all it’s cast and crew became part of our day-to-day lives. However, Jon Hamm not only did that but also made us miss him on the screen. The Emmy award winner has appeared on several other popular acting ventures like Providence,&nbsp;The Division,&nbsp;What About Brian, Kissing Jessica Stein, and many others.</p><p>Meanwhile, fans are eager to find out who Jon Hamm girlfriend is. Also, find the figure of Jon Hamm net worth. On deck, we’ll be delving into Jon Hamm wiki facts, age, height, parents, net worth, and girlfriend.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jon_Hamm_Girlfriend_or_Wife></span>Jon Hamm Girlfriend or Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Breakups are unbearable, but in the case of Jon Hamm, it was unbelievable. Until 2015, he was in a romantic relationship with his screenwriter girlfriend, <strong>Jennifer Westfeldt&nbsp;</strong>from 1997. Despite dating for such a long period of time, Jon never made Jennifer his wife.</p><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Harlow Wiki: Age 20 Dating A Girlfriend? | Albums & Net worth</a></strong></p><p>Everyone wondered why the two didn’t get married despite having a long affair. In an interview, Jon said&nbsp;<span>about his relationship with his long-time girlfriend:</span></p><p><strong>&nbsp;“We may not have a piece of paper that says we’re husband and wife, but after 10 years, Jennifer is more than just a girlfriend. What we have is much deeper and we both know that. To me, people get married when they’re ready to have kids, which I’m not ruling out.’’</strong></p><p>Along with his girlfriend, Jennifer, Jon appeared in&nbsp;Gap-related campaign advertisements. Besides that in 2009, Jon and Jennifer formed their own production company, Points West Pictures. Together the couple adopted a mixed breed dog named <strong>Cora</strong>. Jon once gushed:</p><p><strong>I have a lady, she’s a great lady. I love her a lot, she loves me. We’re on the same page. Whenever that day happens when we’re not on the same page we’ll move forward with it. We’re interested in having our lives be our lives right now and not a third person’s vis-à-vis marriage and whatever that means.</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, Jan and his girlfriend, Jennifer, ended up their 18 years longer relationship in 2015. Nobody had imagined that the power couple like them would be just another celebrity love story. It was the same year the famous movie, Mad Men ended and the actor ended up in rehad due to his alcoholism problem.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/jon-jennifer-z.jpg><p>In a joint statement following their split, they stated:</p><p><strong>“With great sadness, we have decided to separate, after 18 years of love and shared history. We will continue to be supportive of each other in every way possible moving forward.”</strong></p><p>As of now, Jon is possibly single. However, in March, paparazzi spotted him getting flirty with a mystery woman in LA during his morning tennis sessions. Since then, there haven’t been any reports of his dating affairs.</p><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jon Michael Hill: Married To A Wife Or Fumbling Into Dating Someone?</a></strong></p><p>In October&nbsp;2018, the actor appeared with a blonde mystery woman.
