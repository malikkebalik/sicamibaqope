Like in the case of Dan Maurer, who hasn't gotten laid in 12 years and hasn't been able to have sex with his wife of nine years.</p><p>His fault: he, unfortunately, has&nbsp;swollen testicles that weigh about five stone.</p><p>According to a report by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">UNILAD</a>,&nbsp;Dan's condition was so bizarre&nbsp;that even doctors and&nbsp;medical experts remained bewildered with his condition&nbsp;while he&nbsp;remained a prisoner in his own body until 2015.</p><p>Apart from not being able to make love to his wonderful wife Mindy, Dan was also unable to undertake simple everyday jobs like&nbsp;urinate in a toilet, take a shower or have a social life for that matter. Even to be able to take a piss, Dan has to go to the shower since he is not capable of aiming&nbsp;for the toilet bowl due to his enlarged testicles.&nbsp;</p><p>However, ever since he was&nbsp;diagnosed with lymphedema, Dan went through a&nbsp;life-changing surgery, something that has immensely helped him go&nbsp;back to having some semblance of a normal life again. Before getting operated in 2015, Dan had spoken to TLC and said that&nbsp;he felt like "a prisoner of my own body", and that his five stone scrotum made him feel like he was "carrying a ball and chain" with him at all times.</p><p>"The best way I could describe the weight to someone would be to imagine splitting open your scrotum and put in three large bowling balls then sew it back up and carry it around," he said at the time. "I’m constantly in pain, and it’s a lot of weight on your back, so it’s very hard for me to move."</p><p>According to reports by the Sun,&nbsp;Dan first noticed an irregularity in his body when he saw that there was a tiny bit of ‘puffiness’ below his waistline. However, his testicles kept growing bigger in size with time, and there was a point&nbsp;where it stopped him from living his normal life.</p><p>Speaking about his enlarges testicles before the operation, Dan revealed, "When it was smaller I could lift it onto the toilet and pee into the toilet, but when it got bigger there was always a chance I would make a mess, so it was easier to pee into the shower stall and rinse it down with the water. It’s probably been two years since I could use a normal toilet."</p><p>When the bamboozled doctors could not find a conclusive solution or an effective diagnosis for Dan's unique medical condition, they put the entire blame&nbsp;on him and his weight. "We went to our doctor, and he was baffled, he’d never seen anything like it. He basically said ‘you’re fat and there’s really nothing we can do until you lose at least 100 to 150lbs.’"</p><p>But the solutions were never going to come from simply losing body fat, which Dan got to know later. "After exercising it was growing larger, and I realized at that point it really didn’t matter how much weight I lost; it was growing faster than I could lose the weight."&nbsp;</p><p>For the next seven years, Dan lived life as if he was going through hell, but it was a chance TV programme that saved his life, literally. Dan was watching a show about&nbsp;scrotal lymphoedema, after which he suspected that this same condition might be the problem he was facing with his testicles.&nbsp;</p><p>For those who are unaware of the condition, scrotal lymphoedema is an ailment which causes a blockage in the lymphatic vessels, which leads to a build-up outside the testicles, resulting in swelling.</p><p>Once he figured out what was wrong with his scrotum, Dan decided to consult&nbsp;a urologist based out in California, Dr. Joel Gelman who ended up freeing Dan from the shackles of his own testicles by performing surgery on them. It took the doctor&nbsp;eight surgeons and 12 theatre staff during a 14-hour operation in 2015 to remove&nbsp;the huge scrotum from in between Dan’s legs.</p><p>In the latest update on Dan's <a href=# rel=nofollow>GoFundMe page</a>, which came roughly about four months ago, he wrote, "I am feeling pretty good. Still, need to lose more weight, but it is something I have struggled with my whole life.&nbsp;Again thank you all so much for giving me a second chance at life, and I look forward to sharing it with you all."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopZGjeqe11Z5krKyfo7JuwMSsq6KbnJrAbrrOZqqesF2bvLN5kGtksp2Rp8A%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mark-lowry.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mark Lowry">&larr;
