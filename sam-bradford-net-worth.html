I mean, not only was He the greatest human being to ever walk the earth, He’s everything that I want to strive for. He’s everything that anyone should ever want to strive for.”&nbsp;<strong>– Sam Bradford</strong></p><p>“My favorite was always whichever sport was in season. I think these days, it’s almost saddening to see kids who are 10 or 11 and are forced to choose one sport and specialize in that sport and play that sport year-round. By playing different sports… you become a better all-around athlete.”&nbsp;<strong>– Sam Bradford</strong></p><p>“I played a million different sports when I was growing up. I started when I was probably five or six, and we’d go from activity to activity to activity. Finally, my parents just realized that we were missing something in our lives. They realized that it was time for us as a family to start going to church.”&nbsp;<strong>– Sam Bradford</strong></p><p>“I do realize that God has given me so many blessings in my life. I mean, not only with football but with the family that He’s blessed me with and the opportunity He’s given me to grow up in a home that embraces God.”&nbsp;<strong>– Sam Bradford</strong></p><p>“The products in my bathroom are pretty minimal. Issey Miyake makes great cologne, and I use everything from Zirh, especially their shave scream. I really like Mario Badesco aftershave, too. It’s amazing.”&nbsp;<strong>– Sam Bradford</strong></p><p>“For a long time, I thought I was going to play basketball. There are not many 6-4 white guys playing the three spot in the NBA, so I realized I probably didn’t have much of a future in basketball, and that football was probably going to be my best bet.”&nbsp;<strong>-Sam Bradford</strong></p><h2>3 Life Lessons from Sam Bradford</h2><p>After learning everything there is to know about Sam Bradford’s wealth and career, let’s look at some of the things we can all learn from him.</p><h3>1.
