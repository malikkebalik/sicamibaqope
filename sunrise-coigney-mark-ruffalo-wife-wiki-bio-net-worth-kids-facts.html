Best known for his appearances as Hulk in the Avengers movie series, Ruffalo has had his struggles. From living in the dumps to being one of the highest-paid actors, Ruffalo has come a long way from his years on the street. And while things have changed for Ruffalo over the years, there is one thing that has been constant throughout, his relationship with his wife Sunrise Coigney. Not much is known about Coigney and the actor has maintained her silence. So, for this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Sunrise Coigney.</p><p><strong>Christina Sunrise Coigney is an American actress who has been married to Mark Ruffalo since 2000. She has blue eyes, blonde hair, and a triangular body shape. Her zodiac is Virgo.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mark-Ruffalo-wife-Sunrise-Coigney.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life and Career:</h2><p>Christina Sunrise Coigney was born on the 17th of September 1972 in San Francisco, California. Born to a French father, Joel Coigney, and an American mother, Coigney spent most of her early life traveling between France and America. Not much is known about Coigney’s education and the actress has kept the details under wraps.</p><p>As far as her career is concerned, Coigney began acting only after her marriage to Ruffalo. She made her TV debut on the A&E Network legal drama series 100 Centre Street. She had a couple of roles over the next few years including Campfire Stories, In the Cut (2003), and Line of Fire (2003-2005). However, Coigney decided to put an end to her career as an actor following the birth of her children. Talking about her decision to leave acting for her family, Sunrise<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> explained</a>,</p><p>“I had a woman once tell me, ‘You know, Sunrise, you’ll always get a second chance at your career, but you’ll never get a second chance with your children.’”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Business and other things:</h2><p>With her kids grown up, Coigney decided to come out of retirement and launched a jewelry store, Kaviar, and Kind. After running the shop for four years in LA, Coigney decided to close its doors and established a pop-up design shop, Sunny’s Pop in Narrowsburg, New York in 2017.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth:</h2><p>Coigney and her actor husband Mark Ruffalo have a combined net worth of $35 Million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ruffalo, Marriage, and other things:</h2><p>Coigney met Ruffalo when he was living on the streets. The pair first met in 1998 and Mark had nothing to show for. Despite his conditions, Coigney encouraged Mark to work things out. Talking to The Guardian and Men’s Journal, Mark <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> he was living in the streets when he first met Coigney.</p><p>“I was living in a dump and didn’t even have a driver’s license or a credit card. She thought I was a mess, but she believed in me and kept encouraging me.”</p><p>And even though one of his friends had an interest in Coigney, Mark knew he was going to marry her and let nothing stop him.</p><p>At the turn of the decade, Mark started getting more and more roles and was noticed for his masterful acting. When Mark first proposed to Coigney, she turned him down. Mark tried again and the pair ultimately tied the knot in 2000. Their first child, Keen, was born in 2001 and was followed by daughters Bella Noche (born in 2005) and Odette (born in 2007).</p><p>Coigney has been by Ruffalo’s side throughout his career and the pair have been together for nearly three decades. She has been by his side through his brain tumor, the death of his brother, and every up and down in his life. Talking about their life together, Ruffalo <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a>,</p><p>“Sunny and my friendship-slash-marriage-slash-love affair is… changing and growing along the way. Honestly, it hasn’t been without its difficulties, its shortcomings; it hasn’t been without joy or learning or developing.”<br></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A quick write on her husband-Mark Ruffalo:</h2><p>Mark Ruffalo was born on November 22, 1967, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, to a hairdresser mother and a construction painter father. He grew up in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and later moved to California to pursue his acting career.</p><p>Ruffalo began his acting career in theater in the late 1980s, working with various theater groups in Los Angeles.
