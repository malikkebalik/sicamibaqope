The finest NFL players who did not attend college all had very different career paths.&nbsp;</p><p>Some had to start from scratch since they were undrafted free agents, like Steve Tasker and Kurt Warner.&nbsp;</p><p>Others, including Antonio Gates and Deion Sanders, were exceptional athletes in sports other than football before making the conversion.&nbsp;</p><p>Others, like Jim Brown and Gale Sayers, simply possessed natural talent and didn’t require a college education to hone their abilities.</p><p>No matter what their backgrounds, all of these players have shown that excelling in the NFL without a college degree is achievable. They serve as an example for young players worldwide who might not follow the conventional route to the NFL.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FtcbHoq2eZpOkunC6xaVmp56cYr2trdieqaxlpJ2utXnNnq2eql2ssq%2FAjK2mZpufobmms8Ro</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=next><a href=./tennessee-jasmine-robinson-missing-update-is-she-found-yet-wiki-and-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tennessee Jasmine Robinson Missing Update: Is She Found Yet?
