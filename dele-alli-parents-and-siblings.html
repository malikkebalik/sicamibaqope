He is presently on loan from Premier League team Everton to Super Lig team Besiktas, where he plays as an attacking midfielder.</strong></p><p>The midfielder joined Tottenham Hotspur in 2015 after starting his youth career with MK Dons.</p><p>After earning the PFA Young Player of the Year title in his first season, he swiftly established himself as a vital player.</p><p>Dele also made his senior debut for the England national team in 2015 and has participated for the squad at several levels.</p><p>On the pitch, he is renowned for his cunning and aggressive performance. He is adaptable and can play several positions, including striker and offensive midfield.</p><p>The football player is a fan favorite since he has also helped his teammates and scored some incredible goals.</p><p>In addition, Alli is quite active on social media, having millions of followers across Twitter and Instagram. Let’s learn more about the parents and family history of Dele Alli.</p><h2>Meet Kehinde and Denise, the parents of Dele Alli.</h2><p>Given the controversy surrounding the England midfielder’s relationships with both his foster parents, Sally and Alan Hickford, and his birth parents, Kehinde and Denise Alli, many people are looking for Dele Alli’s parents.</p><p>Born to an English mother Denise and a Nigerian father Kehinde, Alli is 27 years old. He is a native of Nigeria.</p><p>After his parents’ divorce, Dele moved back to his father’s house in Nigeria after having lived with his mother for nine years in the US.</p><p>Kehinde, his biological father, is a businessman in Nigeria. Oyo State’s Ibadan is where his father was born.</p><p>Alcoholism plagued Denise Alli, formerly known as Denise Fitch, throughout her early years as a mother.</p><p>According to rumors, she currently resides in the UK, even though her early life and work facts have not yet been made public.</p><p>Before going back to Milton Keynes to live with his mother Denise, the young football player spent a few years with Kehinde Alli. Later, at age 11, Alli signed with MK Dons.</p><p>The football player became weary of his mother’s actions and drug-using problems.</p><p>At some point, when he was thirteen, he moved home with the parents of an MK Dons teammate. They welcomed him with wide arms—Sally and Alan Hickford, whom he now thinks of as his parents. He even began isolating himself from his parents by birth.</p><p>The football player decided not to use his parents’ names in 2016. Alli revealed that his original parents had not been involved in their son’s life since the day they gave up on him, having somehow severed their relationship.</p><p>The young midfield player views Sally and Alan as his parents and believes they are his angels of protection in life. He was never formally adopted, though. Several times during his major occasions, they took the place of his biological parents.</p><p>See Leah Vande Velde, Christian Vande Velde’s Wife, About Her Married Life And Children.</p><h2>Siblings And The Family Tree Of Dele Alli</h2><p>Dele Jermaine Alli is supposedly a prince of Nigeria by birth. Born in Nigeria, he was the son of Denise and Kehinde. At the time, his father had the honor of attending one of Nigeria’s best universities.</p><p>Dele would have had a regal existence if he had never turned down Nigeria in favor of England. His real father was the Crown Prince of Nigeria at the time. Many people think that if the young celebrity went back to Nigeria, he would definitely lead a more opulent life.</p><p>Alli is from a mixed-race family, but her family history is contentious. His mother is English, while his father is a Yorueria. However, his decision to take the Alli surname off of his shirt took a lengthy and contentious turn.</p><p>The young offensive midfield player repeatedly severed his ties with his biological parents due to a terrible upbringing. He has made it clear time and time again that he is unrelated to his parents or the Alli surname.</p><p>Furthermore, following his contentious Snapchat video release, in which the attacking midfielder made racist remarks against an Asian during the COVID-19 pandemic, Dele found himself farther behind in the race.</p><p>It is said that the rising celebrity received a £50,000 fine after being found guilty. The Independent Regulatory Commission claims that after his suspension, he received a court order to embark on an educational trip.</p><p>Dele played U16 soccer as a child, showing off his finest skills both inside and outside the box with some impressive goals. The large European team took notice of the player’s performance.</p><p>Later, the midfield player signed a five-year contract with Tottenham Hotspur, where he scored several braces.</p><p>The youthful midfielder was selected by England Football Management for the 2018 World Cup squad. He played a couple solid games for the team back then.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Viggo Sorensen, Avivasofia, and Giselle Guilmette."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":37}{"1":43,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":60}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/viggo-sorensen/"}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":"https://popularbio.com/avivasofia/"}{"1":37}{"1":43,"2":"https://popularbio.com/giselle-guilmette/"}{"1":60}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Viggo Sorensen</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Avivasofia</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Giselle Guilmette</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Footballer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Alexandra Von Nahmen Wikipedia And Alter: How Old Is DW Correspondent?</a></h3>This page provides information on Alexandra Von Nahmen's Wikipedia entry as well as her age.
